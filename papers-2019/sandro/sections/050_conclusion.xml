    <title>Conclusion</title>

    <para>In this paper I described an alternative approach for running XSpec test suites using a serverless architecture built on AWS. The high level configuration is explained in this paper and more details with step-by-step instructions and code examples are available on my GitHub account. I also analyzed and discussed benefits and constraints of a serverless solution.</para>

    <para>I hope this can be helpful for development teams wishing to implement a CI workflow while reducing operational burden and costs. I would be interested in knowing and possibly helping anyone willing to implement this serverless workflow for running XSpec tests.</para>
